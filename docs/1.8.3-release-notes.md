---

## üéØ What's New in 1.8.3

This release focuses on **critical bug fixes** and **user experience improvements** based on community feedback. We've addressed the most common issues reported by users and enhanced the overall reliability of the toolkit.

---

## üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Fixed "undefined match" Error in Usage Analysis
**Issue:** Users encountered "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')" errors when running usage analysis on projects with non-string translation values.

**Root Cause:** The `validatePlaceholderKeys` function attempted to use string methods on undefined or non-string values without proper type checking.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive null/undefined checks before string operations
- Implemented strict type validation for all translation values
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases in translation processing

**Impact:** Usage analysis now runs smoothly on all project types without crashes.

### 2. Enforced Initialization Checks Across All CLI Scripts
**Issue:** CLI scripts could be executed without proper project initialization, leading to confusing error messages and poor user experience.

**Root Cause:** Missing validation for project initialization status before script execution.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added initialization verification in `i18ntk-usage.js`
- Added initialization verification in `i18ntk-analyze.js`  
- Added initialization verification in `i18ntk-sizing.js`
- Implemented clear error messages guiding users to run `i18ntk init` first

**Impact:** Users now receive helpful guidance when trying to use CLI commands before initializing their project.

### 3. Simplified Frontend Menu Structure
**Issue:** Debug tools in the main menu created confusion for regular users and cluttered the interface.

**Root Cause:** Debug utilities were exposed in the production menu system.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed debug menu option (previously option 12)
- Renumbered remaining menu options for cleaner interface
- Streamlined the user experience for production use

**Impact:** Cleaner, more focused interface that prioritizes essential user workflows.
